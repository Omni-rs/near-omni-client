# near-omni-client

**near-omni-client** is minimal Python library to interact with the NEAR blockchain and [Chain Signatures].

## Features

- Lightweight
- Fully asynchronous

## Getting Started

Install the latest version of `near-omni-client` by running:

```bash
$ pip install near-omni-client

# or if using uv

$ uv add near-omni-client
```

Create a NEAR account and get your private key using the [NEAR CLI].

# ðŸ”§ Deinfra â€” Modular SDK for Multi-chain DeFi Infra

**Deinfra** is a modular Python SDK designed to interact with DeFi protocols, JSON-RPC APIs, and custom external signers (like MPCs or cold wallets) across multiple blockchains like Ethereum and NEAR.

Built for builders who simulate, automate, or execute complex on-chain flows.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Wallet abstraction for Ethereum and NEAR
- âœ… Plugable signer system (MPC-ready, local keys, remote APIs)
- âœ… Clean JSON-RPC clients (NEAR + ETH)
- âœ… Protocol adapters (e.g. Aave, USDC, Compound)
- âœ… Transaction builders (create â†’ sign â†’ send)
- âœ… Async-ready, testable, and production-grade structure

---

## ðŸ§  Designed for

- Simulators of staking/lending/liquidity systems
- Automated bots that sign via external MPC
- DeFi dashboards, analytics, and backtest tools
- Builders of infra, not just frontend consumers

# ðŸ”— near-omni-client

Modular NEAR SDK for bots, dApps, and automated agents.

**near-omni-client** gives you:

- Clean access to the NEAR JSON-RPC API
- Extensible wallet/signing system (MPC, local keys, remote APIs)
- Adapters for higher-level NEAR abstractions (accounts, permissions, etc.)
- Provider factory for mainnet/testnet/localnet switching
- Transaction crafting and pre-signing

Ideal for keepers, bots, simulators, indexers or power-user dApps.

## Modules
- `json_rpc` â€“ low-level JSON-RPC interface
- `wallets` â€“ chain-safe wallet abstraction
- `signers` â€“ pluggable signer implementations (MPC, local, remote)
- `adapters` â€“ opinionated high-level logic
